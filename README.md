## user story 

* As a user, I want to see a game board with cards faced down so I can start the game.


* As a user, I want to click on a card to reveal it, so I can try to find its matching pair.

* As a user, I want visual feedback when I find a matching pair so that I know I've made a correct match.


* As a user, I want visual feedback when I do not find a matching pair so that I can try again.

* As a user, I want to be notified when I match all pairs within the time limit so I can see that I have won.


* As a user, I want to be notified when the time runs out so I can see that I have lost.

* As a user, I want the option to play again after the game ends so I can try to improve my performance.
