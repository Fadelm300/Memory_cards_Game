// In this code:

// *The flipCard function handles the logic for flipping cards and checking for matches.
// *The checkForMatch function compares the data-framework attributes of the two flipped cards.
// *The disableCards function removes event listeners from matched cards.
// *The unflipCards function flips back unmatched cards after a delay.
// *The resetBoard function resets the game state variables.
// *An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) shuffle shuffles the cards' positions.
// *Event listeners are added to each card to handle the click event.
// *The resetGame function resets the entire game, flipping back all cards, re-enabling event listeners, reshuffling the cards, and resetting the board state.
// *An event listener is added to the reset button to trigger the resetGame function.
